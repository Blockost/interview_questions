/**
 * From Square Enix Montr√©al coding test:
 * <p>
 * A playlist is considered a repeating playlist if any of the songs contain a
 * reference to a previous song in the playlist. Otherwise, the playlist will
 * end with the last song which points to null.
 * <p>
 * Implement a function IsRepeatingPlaylist that returns true if a playlist is
 * repeating or false if it is not. For example, the following code prints
 * "true" as both songs point to each other.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Song first = new Song("Hello");
 * Song second = new Song("Eye of the tiger");
 * first.NextSong = second;
 * second.NextSong = first;
 * Console.WriteLine(first.IsRepeatingPlaylist());
 * </pre>
